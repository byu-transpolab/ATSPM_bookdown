# Question {#intro}

Since December 2019, the COVID-19 pandemic has affected life around the world in an unprecedented manner. Mask mandates, social distancing, and stay-at-home orders have changed the way society lives, works, and interacts. With these safety precautions have come less interaction, traveling, and driving on roads and highways. Recent research has confirmed that the COVID-19 pandemic has led to a decrease in traffic volumes across the United States and the world.

Although this is a recent event, the topic has already been researched in many states and countries [@Lee2020; @Lee2021; @Muley2021], but has not been specifically looked at for Utah and Salt Lake Counties in Utah, USA. These counties also contain signal specific traffic volume detectors, which provide a detailed insight into the variation of the effect of COVID-19 on traffic volumes in different locations. The research question therefore is:

  - What was the effect of COVID-19 on traffic volumes in Utah and Salt Lake Counties?
