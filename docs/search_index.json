[["findings.html", " 3 Findings", " 3 Findings During the analysis, several variables were found to have a statistically significant effect on traffic. Month of the year, the time period of the COVID-19 pandemic, and difference in traffic signals were all found to have a significant effect on vehicles per hour of phases 2 and 6 of the signals specified in the methods section. This is seen in Table 3.1. Each individual factor was given a fixed effects model to further investigate where significant factors occurred. Table 3.2 shows that with January as the reference, each month, except for May, was statistically significant. Standard errors were similar across the year, with beta intercepts vary widely. The effect of day of the week though was the complete opposite. Table 3.3 shows that day of the week had little to no affect on variations in hourly volume. Difference in whether or not a date was occuring after March 12, 2021, which was assumed to be the start of the COVID-19 pandemic shutdown in Utah, was shown to be significant in Table 3.4. Individual signals were also shown to be significant in Table 3.5. Like with any research, there were significant limitations to the data and analyses. Through the data cleaning process, it became very clear that many of the data provided were not complete or contained detector errors, leaving most of the data unusable. From 52 signals originally with data, only 7 were used in this analysis. Even with the most accurate data available, further detector error or unknown errors could be present. Other factors such as weather, holidays and major events, school openings, weather, and road conditions were not controlled for. While not perfect, this analysis provides the conclusion that despite seasonal and signal specific variation, hourly volumes were significantly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Note: The Methods section still needs to be updated to reflect the changes in methodology made in the last few days. # Read in Volume dataset Volume_reg &lt;- read_rds(&quot;data/Volume_reg.rds&quot;) # General Linear Regression Model Vol_lm &lt;- lm(Volume_hour ~ day + month + COVID + SignalId, data = Volume_reg) modelsummary(Vol_lm, estimate = &quot;{estimate}, {statistic}, {p.value}{stars}&quot;, title = &quot;General Model&quot;) Table 3.1: General Model Model 1 (Intercept) -1097.077, -154.694, 0.000*** (7.092) day -0.379, -0.336, 0.737 (1.126) month 0.989, 3.737, 0.000*** (0.265) COVIDTRUE -92.667, -45.451, 0.000*** (2.039) SignalId 0.345, 346.319, 0.000*** (0.001) Num.Obs. 162816 R2 0.428 R2 Adj. 0.428 AIC 2388632.5 BIC 2388692.5 Log.Lik. -1194310.259 F 30510.827 # Fixed Effects Model for month Vol_fe_month &lt;- lm(Volume_hour ~ factor(month), data = Volume_reg) modelsummary(Vol_fe_month, estimate = &quot;{estimate}, {statistic}, {p.value}{stars}&quot;, title = &quot;Fixed Effects Model of Month on hourly Volume&quot;) Table 3.2: Fixed Effects Model of Month on hourly Volume Model 1 (Intercept) 636.273, 152.473, 0.000*** (4.173) factor(month)2 37.452, 6.062, 0.000*** (6.178) factor(month)3 -17.588, -2.891, 0.004** (6.085) factor(month)4 -69.079, -11.469, 0.000*** (6.023) factor(month)5 15.131, 2.559, 0.010* (5.912) factor(month)6 57.958, 9.584, 0.000*** (6.047) factor(month)7 54.589, 9.266, 0.000*** (5.891) factor(month)8 77.672, 12.983, 0.000*** (5.983) factor(month)9 53.280, 8.880, 0.000*** (6.000) factor(month)10 38.749, 6.560, 0.000*** (5.907) factor(month)11 -22.485, -3.927, 0.000*** (5.726) factor(month)12 -37.502, -6.741, 0.000*** (5.563) Num.Obs. 162816 R2 0.008 R2 Adj. 0.008 AIC 2478456.7 BIC 2478586.7 Log.Lik. -1239215.359 F 115.631 # Fixed Effects Model for day Vol_fe_day &lt;- lm(Volume_hour ~ factor(day), data = Volume_reg) modelsummary(Vol_fe_day, estimate = &quot;{estimate}, {statistic}, {p.value}{stars}&quot;, title = &quot;Fixed Effects Model of Day of the Week on hourly Volume&quot;) Table 3.3: Fixed Effects Model of Day of the Week on hourly Volume Model 1 (Intercept) 651.634, 309.058, 0.000*** (2.108) factor(day)4 -3.245, -1.089, 0.276 (2.980) factor(day)5 -1.569, -0.527, 0.598 (2.980) Num.Obs. 162816 R2 0.000 R2 Adj. 0.000 AIC 2479704.6 BIC 2479744.6 Log.Lik. -1239848.311 F 0.593 # Fixed Effects Model for COVID Vol_fe_COVID &lt;- lm(Volume_hour ~ factor(COVID), data = Volume_reg) modelsummary(Vol_fe_COVID, estimate = &quot;{estimate}, {statistic}, {p.value}{stars}&quot;, title = &quot;Fixed Effects Model of COVID on hourly Volume&quot;) Table 3.4: Fixed Effects Model of COVID on hourly Volume Model 1 (Intercept) 677.216, 467.631, 0.000*** (1.448) factor(COVID)TRUE -90.767, -34.302, 0.000*** (2.646) Num.Obs. 162816 R2 0.007 R2 Adj. 0.007 AIC 2478531.4 BIC 2478561.4 Log.Lik. -1239262.687 F 1176.651 # Fixed Effects Model for Signals Vol_fe_signal &lt;- lm(Volume_hour ~ factor(SignalId), data = Volume_reg) modelsummary(Vol_fe_signal, estimate = &quot;{estimate}, {statistic}, {p.value}{stars}&quot;, title = &quot;Fixed Effects Model of Signals on hourly Volume&quot;) Table 3.5: Fixed Effects Model of Signals on hourly Volume Model 1 (Intercept) 457.161, 198.951, 0.000*** (2.298) factor(SignalId)4301 -9.342, -3.107, 0.002** (3.007) factor(SignalId)4704 -115.314, -35.667, 0.000*** (3.233) factor(SignalId)4705 -155.534, -48.107, 0.000*** (3.233) factor(SignalId)6303 665.493, 205.837, 0.000*** (3.233) factor(SignalId)6304 677.359, 209.508, 0.000*** (3.233) factor(SignalId)6307 502.285, 130.194, 0.000*** (3.858) Num.Obs. 162816 R2 0.493 R2 Adj. 0.493 AIC 2369140.2 BIC 2369220.2 Log.Lik. -1184562.096 F 26379.559 "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
