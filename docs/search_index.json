The parent repository is available as a free template at https://github.com/byu-transpolab/template_bookdown. The advice in this document comes from numerous sources. Some of it is my own, some has been shared by others. Particular note belongs to: Laurie Garrow Lisa Rosenstein Kara Kockelman The introduction of your report is not simply an introduction, but rather a motivation of why your project matters. What is the cost of not solving this problem? What have been previous attempts to solve this problem? The why is more important than the what. Why is this article worthy of archiving? A three or four-paragraph structure can work well here. Identify the problem and why it matters. A high-level overview of some previous attempts to solve it, and why those attempts were limited (this might be two paragraphs). Describe the approach (very briefly), and provide an overview of what is to come. In this paper we present  "],["methods.html", " 2 Methods 2.1 Data 2.2 Models", " 2 Methods In this chapter, you describe the approach you have taken on the problem. This usually involves a discussion about both the data you used and the models you applied. 2.1 Data Discuss where you got your data, how you cleaned it, any assumptions you made. data(&quot;Car&quot;, package = &quot;mlogit&quot;) car_mlogit &lt;- Car %&gt;% mutate(choice = gsub(&quot;choice&quot;, &quot;&quot;, choice)) %&gt;% dfidx( varying = 5:70, shape = &quot;wide&quot;, choice = &quot;choice&quot;, sep = &quot;&quot;) Often there will be a table describing summary statistics of your dataset. Table 2.1 shows a nice table using the datasummary functions in the modelsummary package. datasummary_balance( ~type, data = car_mlogit %&gt;% select(type, fuel, price, range, size), dinm = FALSE, title = &quot;Descriptive Statistics of Dataset&quot; ) Table 2.1: Descriptive Statistics of Dataset regcar (N=10930) sportuv (N=1048) sportcar (N=880) stwagon (N=4446) truck (N=5628) van (N=4992) Mean Std.

But this is where you describe the mathematical construction of your model, the variables it uses, and other things. Some methods are so common (linear regression) that it is unnecessary to explore them in detail. But others will need to be described, often with mathematics. For example, the probability of a multinomial logit model is \\[\\begin{equation} P_i(X_{in}) = \\frac{e^{X_{in}\\beta_i}}{\\sum_{j \\in J}e^{X_{jn}\\beta_j}} \\tag{2.1} \\end{equation}\\] Use LaTeX mathematics. Youll want to number display equations so that you can refer to them later in the manuscript. Other simpler math can be described inline, like saying that \\(i, j \\in J\\). Details on using equations in bookdown are available here. "],["findings.html", " 3 Findings", " 3 Findings This section need not be overly long. You should address any limitations of your results, such as dependence on underlying assumptions or geographic scope. You should also provide a map for future research. Finally, you should underline the contributions of this work and any practical relevance.
