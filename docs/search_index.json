[["methods.html", " 2 Methods", " 2 Methods UDOT provided ATSPM data for downtown Provo, Orem State Street, University Avenue, Orem 800 N, and Fort Union Boulevard in Cottonwood Heights during the years 2017-2020. It included various performance measure related data, such as Volume, Split Failures, Yellow and Red Actuations, Turning Movement Counts, Arrivals on Red, and Approach Speed.To simplify the analysis, we only focused on Volume. Signal and peak hour specific linear models were calculated and compared from pre-COVID pandemic time periods to during the COVID pandemic time periods. Becuase of the drastic drop of volumes on March 12, 2020, this date was chosen as the threshold to start the during COVID dataset.The UDOT ATSPM data was available through December 31, 2020, so the period of March 12 to December 31 of each year was used for comparison. Linear models were created and graphed together using a facet grid to show and measure the percent change in volumes due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The density of vehicles was greatest during the hours of 7AM to 9AM and 4PM to 6PM, or the AM Peak and PM Peak respectively. Only these hours were used in the analysis. Volume &lt;- read_rds(&quot;data/Volume.rds&quot;) Often there will be a table describing summary statistics of your dataset.

We took into account season, time of day, day of the week, and major holidays. Major holidays were identified to reduce outliers and only Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays were included in the analysis.
