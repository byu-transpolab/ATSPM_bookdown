Masks, social distancing, and stay-at-home orders all changed the way that we lived, worked, and interacted as a society. With these safety precautions came less traveling and driving on our roads and highways. Recent research has shown that the COVID-19 pandemic led to a decrease in traffic volumes not just in the United States, but across the globe (Lee et al. 2020, 2021; Muley et al. 2021). While studies have been done on the effect of COVID-19 on traffic volumes, there has not been any insight into the effect on traffic related performance measures, namely from Automated Traffic Signal Performance Measures (ATSPM) systems. The Utah Department of Transportations ATSPM system is supplied by data collectors at intersections across the state, which then provide raw data that is converted to performance measures such as Split Failures, Yellow and Red Actuations, Turning Movement Counts, Arrivals on Red, and Approach Speed. While traffic volumes may have decreased, did other aspects of traffic captured through these performance measures improve? The research questions therefore are: What was the effect of COVID-19 on ATSPM performance measures? What were the contributing effects from other factors, such as season, time of day, and weather?
